<b>CodeChef Rating Predictor (Machine Learning Project)</b>

📌 <b>Project Overview</b>

This project predicts the rating change for CodeChef users based on their current rank and rating. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and forecast potential rating shifts.

⚙️ <b>Features</b>

Automated Data Collection – Utilizes Selenium to scrape data directly from the CodeChef website.

Data Visualization – Matplotlib is used to analyze and visualize the collected data.

Machine Learning Model – Implements Polynomial Regression using sklearn to predict rating changes.

User Input – Accepts current rank and rating as input to predict the new rating.

🛠️ <b>Technologies Used</b>

Python – Core programming language.

Selenium – For automating browser actions and web scraping.

Matplotlib – Data visualization and analysis.

scikit-learn (sklearn) – For machine learning and polynomial regression.

🚀 <b>How It Works</b>

Data Collection – Selenium automates the browser to scrape past contest data from CodeChef.

Data Analysis – Matplotlib is used to plot and understand trends in the rating changes.

Model Training – A polynomial regression model is trained using sklearn's PolynomialFeatures.

Prediction – Based on the current rating and rank, the model predicts the potential new rating.
